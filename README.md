# BD Job Portal Project Backend

## Project Description

**Project Name**: BD Job Portal Project

## Overview

The **BD Job Portal** Project Backend provides a robust platform for managing job listings and applications. Built with **Django** and **Django REST Framework**, it allows for seamless interaction between `employer` (Employer) and `job seeker` (Job seeker).

Employers can create and manage job postings, while job seekers can browse, apply, and track their applications. The project also includes features like role-based access control, email notifications, and user dashboards, making it a comprehensive solution for **job portal management**.

Additionally, the use of **PostgreSQL** ensures reliable data handling and scalability, while maintaining flexibility for future enhancements.

### Installation Steps

1. Open `command prompt` in the folder directory where you want to create & run the project locally

2. Copy the `repository_url` to **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sayed8901/job_portal_system_backend.git
   cd job_portal_system_backend
   ```

3. **Create a virtual environment**

   ```bash
   python -m venv job_portal_venv
   cd job_portal_venv
   Scripts\activate.bat
   cd ..
   ```

4. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   code .
   ```

<br>

5. **Environment Variables Configuration**

- `N.B.`: To run the application, you need to configure environment variables. Create a file named `.env` inside the root project directory of your project named `job_portal_system`.

<br>

6. **Then, add the `SECRET_KEY` in that `.env` file:**

- SECRET_KEY=(Your SECRET_KEY)

      --> N.B.: please see the `### Note for: Getting the SECRET_KEY` part for better understanding

- Copy the `secret key` from the temporarily created project's `temp_settings.py` file

<br>

7. **Add the supabase postgreeSQL database credentials** in `.env` file:

- DB_NAME=(Your database name)
- DB_USER=(Your database username)
- DB_PASSWORD=(Your database password)
- DB_HOST=(The host for your database)
- DB_PORT=(The port for your database)

      --> N.B.: please see the `### Note for: Database Setup` part for better understanding

<br>

8. **Add the email sending accessibility credentials** in `.env` file:

- EMAIL=(Your email address for sending emails)
- EMAIL_PASSWORD=(Your email password or an app-specific password)

      --> N.B.: please see the `### Note for: Email Setup` part for better understanding

<br>

9. **Also, Add the Sandbox Credentials for SSLCommerz Payment Gateway Methods Integration** in `.env` file:

- store_ID=(Your sandbox merchant account's store_id)
- store_password=(Your sandbox merchant account's store_password)

      --> N.B.: please see the `### Note for: Payment Gateway Method Integration using SSLCommerz Setup` part for better understanding

<br>

10. **Apply migrations**

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

11. **Creating superuser**

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

12. **Run the development server**

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

<br>

**Finally, Access the application**

- Local: http://127.0.0.1:8000/
- Admin Panel: http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/login/

---

<br>

## 13. Extra Note for: Getting the `SECRET_KEY`

1. **to get the `SECRET_KEY`, Temporarily `Create a new project` named `temp_job_portal_system` anywhere `outside the current project directory` (may be in the `desktop`, `documents` or `downloads`, wherever you want, just outside the current project directory)**

   ```bash
   django-admin startproject temp_job_portal_system
   ```

   <br>

2. **After creating a project named `temp_job_portal_system`,**

- Manually go to that `temp_job_portal_system` project directory folder to get the `settings.py` file.
- Rename that `settings.py` file to `temp_settings.py`
- Copy that `temp_settings.py` file and paste it to a temporary directory like `desktop` or `documents` folder.

3. **Delete the project** named `temp_job_portal_system`

- As we have already copied the `temp_settings.py` file from the `temp_job_portal_system` project, now we can delete it.
- So now, Manually delete the `temp_job_portal_system` project directory

---

<br>

## 14. Extra Note for: Database Setup

1. **Setting up in supabase:**

- Go to `supabase.com` and log in with your `GitHub` account.
- Navigate to the dashboard and click on **New project**.
  - Select your organization (e.g., `sayed8901’s Org`).
  - Provide a relevant project name (e.g., `hr_corp-db`).
  - Set a strong database password (consider using a password generator) and make sure to copy it, as you will need it later.
  - Choose the **Region** as **South Asia (Singapore)** and click **Create new project**.

2. **Updating settings.py:**

- Make sure to replace the default SQLite database settings with PostgreSQL settings in your `settings.py` file:

```python
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql_psycopg2',
        'NAME': env("DB_NAME"),
        'USER': env("DB_USER"),
        'PASSWORD': env("DB_PASSWORD"),
        'HOST': env("DB_HOST"),
        'PORT': env("DB_PORT"),
    }
}
```

3. **Update the .env file:**

- In your .env file, replace/update the values for `DB_NAME`, `DB_USER`, `DB_HOST`, and `DB_PORT` based on your supabase database configuration.
- You should also set `DB_PASSWORD` with the password you generated earlier.

```python
DB_NAME=postgres
DB_USER=your_db_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password
DB_HOST=your_db_host
DB_PORT=your_db_port
```

**To find the required database connection details in supabase:**

- Go to the `supabase dashboard` and select your project.
- Choose the `database` option from the left sidebar.
- Alternatively, you can select the `connect` button from the top-right corner.
- Select the `Python` tab from the `Connection string`
- and go to `Connection parameters` for your database details.

## 15. Extra Note for: Email Setup

To set up email notifications for your Django application, follow these steps:

1. **Getting App Password**:

   - Log in to your `Google` account.
   - Click on your account profile image and select **Manage your Google Account**.
   - Navigate to the **Security** tab.
   - Enable **2-Step Verification** if it is not already enabled.
   - After enabling, scroll down and click on **App passwords**.
   - Provide an app name (e.g., `hrcorp`) and click **Create**. A `password` will be generated; copy this password;
   - paste this `password` onto the `EMAIL_PASSWORD` field in the `.env` file.

2. **Updating project settings.py**:

   - In your `settings.py` file, make sure to set up the email configuration as follows:

   ```python
   EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend'
   EMAIL_HOST = 'smtp.gmail.com'
   EMAIL_USE_TLS = True
   EMAIL_PORT = 587
   EMAIL_HOST_USER = env("EMAIL")
   EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = env("EMAIL_PASSWORD")
   ```

## 16. Extra Note for: Payment Gateway Method Integration using SSLCommerz Setup

**Payment Gateway Integration** (using SSLCommerz & sandbox account)

- To integrate Payment Gateway Method Integration using `SSLCommerz`, we need to create and use `Sandbox Account`.

1. **Create Sandbox Account**:

   - Go to [SSLCommerz Developer](https://developer.sslcommerz.com/) → click “sandbox account” → [Create Sandbox Account](https://developer.sslcommerz.com/registration/).

   - Confirm registration via the email `verification` code.
   - Once verified, you will get an additional mail containing some important information including **`Store ID`** & **`Store Password`**. note it down.

2. **saving Sandbox Credentials** in `.env` file

- You need to store the Sandbox Credentials for SSLCommerz Payment Gateway Methods Integration in the `.env` file you created earlier in your main project directory. You need to store the following:

  - `store_ID`: (Your sandbox merchant account's store_id)
  - `store_password`: (Your sandbox merchant account's store_password)

## Conclusion

In developing the **Job Portal Project** backend, the goal was to create an efficient and scalable platform for managing job advertisements and applications. By leveraging **Django** and **PostgreSQL**, I ensured a secure and robust system that allows **employers** and **job seekers** to interact seamlessly.

I believe the platform's features, including role-based access, job management, and application tracking, will significantly improve the hiring process for organizations and make job seeking more efficient.

I am excited to see the positive impact this system can bring, and if you have any questions or would like to contribute, feel free to reach out!
